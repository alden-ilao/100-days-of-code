**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 0: Friday Jan 10, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Read a handful of articles on the foundations course of The Odin Project. Internet, computer basics, server/client model

**Thoughts**: While this is fairly basic, it was a good refresher and it is important to lay a foundational understanding of what I am trying to achieve. I really like The Odin Project. My goal is to stick with these lessons until the end. It truly is a resource compiling all the "how i wish i learned development". This is a great community.

My only concerns is that by comitting to this path I am just finding ways to avoid giving my all, searching for jobs. I have developed applications, multiple full-stack applications. I feel like I need to face my confidence issues and just put myself on the market and apply.

Regardless, I do enjoy the course.
